\## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Steps



The cleaning pipeline includes:



\### 1. \*\*Column Pruning\*\*

\- Removed irrelevant or redundant columns not useful for analysis.



\### 2. \*\*Duplicate Handling\*\*

\- Dropped exact duplicate rows to ensure uniqueness.



\### 3. \*\*Type Conversion\*\*

\- Converted `product\_price` and other numeric fields to proper `float` types.

\- Ensured all numeric columns are free of non-numeric characters.



\### 4. \*\*Missing Value Imputation\*\*

\- Imputed missing numeric values using \*\*median\*\* strategy for robustness.



\### 5. \*\*Sales Volume Normalization\*\*

\- Created a new column `sales\_volume\_clean` to standardize textual sales volume into a consistent format.
